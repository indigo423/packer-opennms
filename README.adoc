= Packer setup for OpenNMS
This repository allows to create base box image which can be used in Vagrant.
It is also possible to use other builder to generate Amazon EC2, Docker, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack or VMware images.

The default configuration is build to generate a Vagrant Base Box image.
It will use the Chef provisioner and the OpenNMS Chef cookbook to install and configure OpenNMS.

The system is build with a disk size of 40 GB. Other parameters for RAM and CPU depend on the configuration in the packer template JSON file.

== Dependencies
The repository link:https://github.com/opennms-forge/opennms-chef.git¢[opennms-chef] is included as 'git submodule' in 'ubuntu-14.04/cookbooks/opennms-light' to avoid a fork of the Chef cookbook.

IMPORTANT: If you want to make changes in the OpenNMS cookbook, please commit to link:https://github.com/opennms-forge/opennms-chef.git¢[opennms-chef] and run `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`
in the 'packer-opennms' repository to get the cookbook updated.

== Requirements and environments
The cookbook is build based on the following requirements:

 * Internet access to download Ubuntu 14.04 ISO install files
 * link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox 4.3.28]
 * link:http://www.packer.io/downloads.html[packer]
